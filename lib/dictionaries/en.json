        "Mayouš (pronounced \"May-yâu-sh\", IPA: /majˈou̯ʃ/) is a premium shirt brand developed by Thanh Viet specifically for the Czech market. The name Mayouš draws inspiration from the popular Czech name \"Matouš\" (Matthew), creating a familiar and appealing connection with local consumers.",
        "The \"May\" element carries dual meanings: in Vietnamese, \"may\" refers to sewing and garment making, the core business of the company. Simultaneously, \"May\" also evokes the image of clouds, representing the softness, lightness, and airiness that characterize the Tencel, Cotton, and Gracell blend fabrics and Vietnamese textiles.",
        "The suffix \"-ouš\" in Czech is often used as a term of endearment, creating a sense of attachment and affection for customers in the Czech Republic. The name Mayouš thus represents not just a fashion brand but a symbol of gentleness, comfort, and affection, emphasizing the care and refinement in each product.",
        "With our slogan \"Light as breeze, green with ease,\" we emphasize both the comfort of our fabrics and our commitment to environmental sustainability. From Vietnam to Czechia, we bring the finest craftsmanship and eco-friendly practices to create shirts that not only look good but feel good to wear and are good for the planet.",
        "At Mayouš, we believe that fashion should be both beautiful and responsible. Our shirts are designed for the modern professional who values quality, comfort, and sustainability. Each shirt is crafted with care, using premium materials that are gentle on the skin and the environment.",
        "Our journey from Vietnam to Czechia represents our commitment to bringing the best of Vietnamese craftsmanship to the European market. We are proud of our heritage and excited to share our passion for quality and sustainability with our customers in the Czech Republic and beyond."
